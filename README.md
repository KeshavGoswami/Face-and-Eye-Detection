<h1>Face and Eye Detection</h1>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<li>	Face detection using Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers (haarcascade_frontalface_default).
</li>
<li>	Extend the same for eye detection(haarcascade_eye)
</li></ul>

<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
